This script is like my Mac tool but it is for Windows. Contributions of things to repair are welcome. The idea of this script is to run it against a machine and solve most issues or at least get the machine in a clean state.

The idea of this script is that you would load it in to Casper or Absolute Manage as an On Demand package. A user could run it before calling desktop support and in many many cases it would repair the issue at hand. So many times we bang our heads against the wall trying to fix a machine when it turns out the problem was something silly like a corrupt Cache file or a permissions issue. The benefit is employee self-help and empowering your employees to help themselves so they don't need to call you up at 3am for something silly.
